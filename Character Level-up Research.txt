	Our team requires a level up system for the game aspect of our application.  At first I tried to devise my own,
but, instead decided to seek some precedence.  I visited the following websites...

https://answers.unity.com/questions/125359/rpg-algorithms.html

https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/13638/algorithm-for-dynamically-calculating-a-level-based-on-experience-points
								
http://howtomakeanrpg.com/a/how-to-make-an-rpg-levels.html

With the information I found i was able to find a function that I think works well for our project.

int nextLevel(int currentLevel){
	double difficulty = 1.5;
	int basexp = 1000;
	return basexp * pwr(level, exponent);
}
