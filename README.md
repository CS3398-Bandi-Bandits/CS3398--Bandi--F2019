## General info
<u>Developers:</u> Dakota Ruhl, Kenneth Omo, Jose , Victor Hernandez, Devon Tyson

<center>The purpose of this project is to create an application that tracks exercise data to level up a character. The intended audience is for people who would like to get fit in a fun way. We hope that this application impacts the well-being of our users by inspiring them to go to the gym. </center>

## Technologies
Unity game engine <br>
Pedometer <br>
Java SDK <br>
Andriod App builder <br>
Andriod Studio <br>
Android Phone <br>

## Features
 <b>Personal character:</b> <br> 
 Have a virtual character that represents the real you. This character will level up as you workout.<br>
  I, Devon as a gamer, want a game that provides some real world benefit, so that i can feel productive about playing video games. <br><BR>
  Completed by Dakota<BR>
  
<b>View Stats:</b> <br>
  View your real life stats in the game and how they correspond to your character's progression level. All users can use this. <br>
  I, Victor, as a highly-competitive gamer, want a mobile game that can display workout data between friends so that I can push myself to   be the very best (that no one ever was).<br><br>
  Completed by Devon Tyson.<BR>
 
  
<b>Real Life Levelling:</b> <br>
 Level up your character by increasing your steps and logging workouts each day. As you progress your workouts in real life, you character will progress as well. <br>
I, Jose, as an intermediate weightlifter want an app that organizes workout schedule in a way that allows me to track my improvements over time.<br><br>
Completed by Jose Herrera.<BR>
 Source code can be found under src/WOPackage.  A WorkoutLog class is created when training mode is selected.  Users enter workouts and then the WorkoutLog class calculates an experience number.  Victor's Gui sends the number to Devon's Player object, which then potentially levels up.  
  
<b>Graphical User Interface:</b> <br>
  View a user interface that displays your progression in the game that will reflect your real life progression. <br>
I, Jose, as a user with little computer know-how I want an intuitive GUI so that I can seamlessly navigate the software.<br><br>
Completed by Victor Hernandez<br>
Source code can be found under GUIPrototype.zip and can be accessed by Andriod Studio.
This code is the user interface for the application.


<b>Biometrics:</b> <br>
Built in pedometer used to track steps right from your phone. <br>
I, Kenny, as a person who walks to campus from really far away, would like to keep track of how many
steps it takes to get to my class.<br><br>
Completed By Kenneth Omo<br>
Source code is under Pedometer folder on GitHub and can be accessed by Andriod Studio.
This code is used for tracking the number of steps a person can take while the application is open.
